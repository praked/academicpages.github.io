<h2 align="left"> Ongoing Projects & Interests</h2>

<p align="justify"> I'm currently working on my thesis where, broadly, my goal is to develop an scalable distributed agent environment for swarm robotics experiments. The platform is a low-cost experimentation platform that can be used for any available swarm robot with minimal or no changes. The said platform helps the user to collect state data from
the individual robots during the experiments. The platform provides the user with a glimpse of both the micro
and macro world of swarm robots during a test. I am working on supporting heterogeneous agents onto the said
platform. The platform takes inspiration from Cellular Automata with a collection of agents and patches located in
parallel, one on top of the other. The platform also exploits the phenomenon of Stigmergy, which is a mechanism
of indirect coordination, through the environment, between agents or actions. </p> 

<p align="justify"> I am also interested in multi-agent robotics and its applications, human-robot interaction. Building novel robots has always excited me.</p> 

<p align="justify"> Apart from my work, I enjoy travelling and learning about new cultures and languages. I really like to find interconnections and variation of languages of different places. I love to sketch and paint. I am also an avid reader of world politics and history.

<h2 align="left"> News/Updates</h2>
<p align="justify">Apr'20: Enrolled in the following MOOCs and online specialisations: University of Torontoâ€™s Self-Driving Cars Specialization and The Construct's Course on ROS2. </p>
<p align="justify">Apr'20: Our paper titled <a href="https://praked.github.io/pk-publication/Design-of-a-real-time-autonomous-in-cabin-sensory-system-to-detect-passenger-anomaly">"Design of a real-time autonomous in-cabin sensory system to detect passenger anomaly"</a> was accepted at <a href="https://2020.ieee-iv.org/">IV 2020 Workshops</a>. Here our focus is on building intelligent transportation systems and designing in-cabin low-cost sensors for passenger state identification. We use sensor fusion techniques and various machine learning algorithm for testing our prototype. </p> 
<p align="justify">Mar'20: Unfortunately I am temporarily stopping my thesis work due the nationwide lockdown caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Stay safe folks.  </p>
<p align="justify">Jan'20: Started working on my thesis work with a goal to develop an scalable distributed agent environment for swarm robotics experiments. </p>
<p align="justify">Sep'19: I presented our paper and research work at 2019 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety <a href="http://icves2019.org/">ICVES 2019</a> in Cairo, Egypt at the German University in Cairo. </p>
<p align="justify">July'19: Our paper titled <a href="https://praked.github.io/pk-publication/Design-and-development-of-an-autonomous-emergency-vigilance-system-for-passenger-vehicle">"Design and development of an autonomous in-seat passenger state identification in a modern vigilance enabled public transportation system"</a> was accepted at <a href="http://icves2019.org/">ICVES 2019</a>. My research focuses on building intelligent transportation systems and designing sensors for passenger state identification. </p> 
<p align="justify">May'19 - July'19: Worked at the <a href="http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/robotics/people.html">ARMS  lab</a>, led by <a href="https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~asinha/">Dr. Arpita Sinha</a> at IIT Bombay, India.  I worked on additive and subtractive self-assembly algorithms for a swarm of Kilobots. </p>
